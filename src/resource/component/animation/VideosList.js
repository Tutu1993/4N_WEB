		summary: 'Echoing to the resonance of the sprung balance which animates the dial, the jumping minutes and hours generate a poetic pulsation during a magic instant, recreated each time.  In successive strata,  the dial displays the subtle complexity of the display mechanism, through its discs carousel.',

		summary: 'The technical and ergonomic stakes have founded the architecture and design of this complication. Three subset can independently enter in motion at the moment of the hour jump : The hour cage on the left side with its 4 discs, the disc of the tens of minutes at the center, and the minute cage with its 5 discs on the right. This display principle which allows the digital hour to stand majestically at the center of the dial, hides an extremely sophisticated kinematics, protected by several patents. The overall movement contains 520 components with 86 rubies.',
